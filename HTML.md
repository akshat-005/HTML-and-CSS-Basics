* head: This tag contains all the meta data, i.e. data which is not displayed on the screen
* body: This tag contains all the data on the main page

* div tag and span tag: for structuring the text on the page
  * div takes the full width of the line but span does not
* h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 (heading) tags
* b,u, i : bold, underline, italics
* a tag: for creating links
  * href attribute: where we want the user to go
  * things between the a tag [<>] appear as the text on the link
  * target= "_blank" attribute takes us to the desired link destination but opens it on a new tab

* img tag: for rendering or putting an image on your page
  * src = location or the file of the image
  * width
